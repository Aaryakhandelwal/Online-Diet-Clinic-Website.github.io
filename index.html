              It has been a fantastic experience with Prachi as a nutrition consultant. How we see our food has become a love; eating the right food at the right time and mood proved very beneficial.<br><br>
               She makes certain points very clear: that the kitchen being a pharmacy, can help control lots of health issues and improve the well-being of any individual. But for us, she has not only helped as a dietician, but she has also become ur best friend, teacher, and guide.<br><br>
               She always says that everyone should love what they eat. Prachi, as a guide, helped us in this part very beautifully, which helped us to lose weight and get rid of medication. To end this, I feel we r lucky to have Prachi, a game-changer.              <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>

              I have never been to a dietician before. This was the very first time I got
              a chance to talk to one of the highly knowledgeable, excellent at communicating, and fun to talk to, Dr. Prachi Singhal. <br>I would highly recommend her to everyone. It's been one month and one week. I have lost 12 kgs. I can feel the differences in my body after making the recommended changes. <br>
              I have learned how to put together healthy, delicious meals that aren't repetitive with her help and guidance. She is so
              helpful and supportive. Still, a long way to go with her to achieve my goal.<br>
              Thank you so much, Dr. Prachi, for all the efforts you have put in for me to loose weight.            <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>

              Hi Dr. Prachi 
              First, I would thank you so much for your immense care and guidance in
              my weight loss journey, which is still ON.<br>
              My 11-week journey from 75 kg to 65.2 kg and lots of inches loss.
              Yipeeeee
              Specifically, not only weight loss, I have improved health-wise a lot. I
              feel more energetic and confident too. Due to my busy life style, I got into
              bad food habits and gained too much weight. There was a
              time when I didn't even want to look in the mirror or pose for a
              picture. <br>
              But thanks to you, Dr. Prachi, I'm sharing this transformation. 
              Thanks to your constant support and push. I came this far, and the
              journey will go on.
